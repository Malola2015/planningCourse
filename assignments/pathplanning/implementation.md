# Integrate path-planning algorithms with PDDL planners

## Objectives

* Understand the importance of path-planning in robotics.
* Study and implement well-known path planning algorithms.
* Compare the algorithms using different heuristics.
* Integrate PDDL planners with path planning algorihtms.


## Introduction

The pseudocode that will be used in this practical assignment is taken from the article [Theta*: Any-Angle Path Planning on Grids](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.3843.pdf) published in the Journal of AI Research, 39: 533-579 (2010). 

The algorithms will be implemented in Python and it is strongly recommended to use Git and make ```Commits/``` betweens the members of the group (max 2 members).

The practical assignment is inspired in the article published by Pablo Muñoz, María D. R-Moreno and David F. Barrero. [Unified framework for path-planning and task-planning for autonomous robots](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889016302184?via%3Dihub). Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Vol. 82, pp:1-14 August 2016.
